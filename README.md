# QuickRail Chatbot

## Project Description
QuickRail is an interactive train ticket booking system built using Streamlit. It allows users to book train tickets for different routes across India. The chatbot takes users through the booking process step-by-step, from selecting departure and destination stations to class preferences and payment. This app also provides real-time information about stations, train statuses, PNR status, and fare details.

### Key Features:
- **Train Ticket Booking**: Users can select their departure and destination stations, choose the class (Sleeper/AC), and proceed to make payments.
- **Real-Time Information**: The app fetches live data on station details, train statuses, and PNR status using the IRCTC API.
- **Payment Integration**: The system supports mock payment processing, where users can select their preferred payment method.
- **Lottie Animations**: Beautiful animations enhance the user experience during the booking process.

## Tech Stack
